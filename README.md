Basic Exercise in python 

some tips:
----------
1. Be as persistent as you can before looking at hints or the solution. Persistence is gold in programming.
2. Sometimes taking a break is the best thing you can do to solve a problem.
3. When getting an error, don't panic, but look closely at the error message. Knowing how to fix errors is as important as knowing to write programs.
