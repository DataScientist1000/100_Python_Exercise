# Question: Add a new pair of key (e.g. c ) and value (e.g. 3 ) to the
# dictionary and print out the new dictionary.

# d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
# Expected output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}

d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

d["c"] = 3

print(d)

# Refer to key c  and use the assignment operator to assign a value to the key.
# Note that dictionaries are unordered collections, so don't worry
#  about the order, it's always random.
# Adding pairs of keys and values is straightforward as you can see.
# Note though that you cannot fix the order of the dictionary items.
# Dictionaries are unordered collections of items.
